# Process

[How did you go about creating this project]

Agreed on our way of working 
- Agreed on a single method of communication about this project (slack)
- Agreed on what branches we will work in and will only merge in main after communicating to the rest of the team via slack 
- Agreed where our single point of truth for this application will be stored (Figma) 
- Agreed a rough plan of how we intend the week to go 

Understanding the problem 
- Tried to understand the core need for the application and wrote this in a single sentence

Defining and refining  
- Defined the core requirements of the application and added each requirement as tickets in a kanban board  
- Went through each ticket as a team to ensure we are all aligned with the requirments and how we indend to tackle the ticket 

Design planning 
- Found a few examples of similar journalling websites and took full screenshots of them 
- Using Figma, as a team we went through each of these example screenshots and discussed what we liked and disliked about thier design 
- Then as a team we drew a LoFi wireframe of our application 

Organising and planning 
- Assigned a few tickets to each team memeber 
- Planned regular catch up sessions each day (morning, afternoon, evening) to see how everyone is doing and if we need to re-align/re-distribute work
